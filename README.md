# sqsPublisher

This short project is part of the Cloud Fundamentals with C# and AWS course by [Nick Chapsas](https://dometrain.com/).

It is a C# built publisher that interacts with SQS on AWS. The corresponding SQS Consumer can be found [here](https://github.com/SMooreSwe/SQSConsumer).

By completing the course I hope to familiarise myself with the following AWS services, whilst also improving my C# and .Net skills.

- SQS
- S3
- SNS
- Secrets Manager
- DynamoDB
- Lambda
